                <td><a href="https://allegravia.github.io/website/about/">Dr. Allegra Via</a> is a physicist and scientific researcher at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Pathology (IBPM) of the National Research Council (CNR, Rome, IT). She is involved in the design, organisation and delivery of bioinformatics training courses, in Train the Trainer activities, and collaborate with other ELIXIR’s nodes on many training-related initiatives. She has a long track record of academic teaching (Macromolecular Structures, Python programming, Bioinformatics, Biochemistry, Protein interactions). Allegra's main research interests include protein structural bioinformatics, protein structure and function prediction and analysis, and protein interactions. She's also strongly interested in what researchers have discovered about how people learn and how best to teach them, and how research findings in the science of learning (educational psychology) can be translated into common teaching practice. Allegra is a member of the Global Organisation of Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training (GOBLET) and a Software/Data Carpentry Instructor and Instructor trainer.</td>

He is passionate about the development of automated tools and workflows for bioinformatics analyses, 16S rRNA amplicon sequence analysis, microbial genome wide association studies, online
bioinformatics databases for sequences with related metadata (clinical and epidemiological) and machine learning. I would like to learn more about in-silico gene editing as an avenue to cure genetic diseases search as cancer and sickle cell.
My spare time involves teaching anything I have learned about systems, programming, web development and data analysis. Before joining the Carpentries, I founded and led the Mozilla Community in Uganda for 5 exciting and productive years. When I’m not at my computer, I spend time reading, exercising and playing the music keyboard.</td>

                <td>Dr. Sarah Brown is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Data Science Initiative at Brown University affiliated to the Division of Applied Mathematics. Dr. Brown received her BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering from Northeastern University. Dr Brown builds machine learning tools that bridge from data-agnostic methods to systems that fuel data driven discovery in historically qualitative domains. Her work approaches this from two fronts: building interfaces that enable my algorithms to leverage domain scientists' qualitative expertise and developing model-based machine learning solutions through close collaboration with domain scientists. Sarah has been an instructor with The Carpentries since November 2017 serves as a member of the Lesson Infrastructure Committee. Currently she serves as treasurer and previously as a workshop organizer for Women In Machine Learning, Inc. She has served as general co-chair of the Broadening Participation in Datamining Program, a founding member of the Black in AI organizing committee and in various leadership roles in the National Society of Black Engineers.</td>

Her interests include the carpentries, sophisticated quantitative methodologies and understanding why some youth do well even though they face severe adversities (e.g. poverty, violence, abuse), also known as resilience. In doing so, she makes use of innovative quantitative methodologies (i.e. latent variable modelling, invariance testing, latent variable difference testing and moderation analysis in Mplus, SPSS and R) to investigate the complex processes embedded in resilience. </td>
