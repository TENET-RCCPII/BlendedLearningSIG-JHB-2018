The Carpentries (https://carpentries.org/), brings Software and Data Carpentry together under an umbrella to teach foundational computational, coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide. We are a diverse, global community of volunteer Instructors, helpers, Trainers, Maintainers, champions, member organizations, supporters, and staffs.

#### CarpentryConnect Johannesburg 2018 and Conference Cheatsheet


##### Code of Conduct

As a member and conference participant, you are requested to familiarize yourself with The Carpentries' [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

*Code of Conduct in Short*: The Carpentries are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors. Harassment in any form or behavior intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct we ask that you report it to the CarpentryCon TaskForce members or the Code of Conduct committee members (Karin Lagesen, Kari Jordan and Malvika Sharan) at the conference in person, by email or on Slack, who will take the appropriate action to address the situation. You can also reach out to the Carpentries Policy Committee by emailing policy@carpentries.org.

Feel free to reach out to the organizers and staff if they can improve your experience as a member at The Carpentries and CarpentryCon. Attendees must be prepared to abide by our Code of Conduct (see *Allies, Carpentries, Code of Conduct, Inclusion, Emergency*).

#### Data Carpentry

[Data Carpentry (DC)](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) provides researchers high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. There will be an information desk where you can collect information on DC team, their work, workshops and various ways to get involved with their activities.

The Carpentries is governed by the newly formed Executive Council, to whom the Executive Director reports.

### I: Icebreaker, Inclusion

We want to create an inclusive and welcoming environment at the conference. We are providing travel assistance to facilitate attendance from as wide a group as possible.

#### Join the Carpentries

There are several ways to become a member of [The Carpentries community](https://carpentries.org/community/) and support its work. At CarpentryCon, there will be different booths for The Carpentries and opportunities to meet the volunteer members to learn more about it. See [here](https://carpentries.org/join/) for more detail.

### K: Keynote Speakers, Knowledge sharing


#### Knowledge sharing



### L: Lightning talks, Library Carpentry

#### Lightning talks



#### Library Carpentry

Library Carpentry, is made by librarians, for librarians to help you automate repetitive, boring, error-prone tasks, create, maintain and analyse sustainable and reusable data, work effectively with IT and systems colleagues, better understand the use of software in research and much more. Library Carpentry introduces you to the fundamentals of computing and provides you with a platform for further self-directed learning. See [here](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/our-sponsors/) for more detail. 

### M: Medical, Mentoring, Meet-ups

#### Medical



#### Mentoring

Mentorship is an important part of the Carpentry experience. As Instructors, we both teach and mentor our Learners. We also mentor each other as Instructors, learning something new from each other every time we teach and interact with one another. The Mentoring Subcommittee offers guidance to new and continuing Instructors through weekly discussion sessions, where Instructors from the global Carpentry community gather to share their experiences and learn from each other. This is a fantastic opportunity to interact with other Carpentry Instructors from around the world. (Read more on the The Carpentries [Blog1](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/10/mentoring-wrap-up.html) and [Blog2](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/03/next-round-mentoring.html)).

There are several things planned for you at the conference, which include break-out sessions, social activities, badges to show your involvement and a desk where you can learn more about the existing mentoring program and its activities.

#### Meet-ups


### N: New Members, Name Tags, Nursing

#### New Members

Are you new to The Carpentries? Do you want to learn more about the organization and how you can support it? CarpentryConnect Johannesburg is the place for you. Actually a **_better_** start for you than the rest of us had, as you will have an opportunity for face-to-face networking and interaction. We understand that it could be frightening if you don't know anyone, but the community has a history of being very friendly and inclusive, so don't be afraid to say 'Hi' and introduce yourself. You will be surprised how many lasting collaborations you will make at the conference. Join the ice-breaking session to get a head start to networking, and when in doubt, contact the Welcome Team.

#### Name Tags


Name tags are a great way for participants to strike up conversations with other participants or volunteers. You can collect your name tag at the registration desk (don't forget to bring your registration ticket). 

#### Nursing



### P: Pronouns, Photography, Posters, Pre-conference, Post-conference

#### Pronouns

It has become a general practice to share pronouns (He/She/They/Ze etc.) on conference name tags. For those unfamiliar with the practice of sharing pronouns at the conference, it goes something like this: “Name: Malvika Sharan. Pronouns: she/her”. This practice is important for making sure that we use correct pronouns, specifically for our trans, queer, and gender non-conforming community members you will meet at CarpentryConnect.

### S: Skill-up, Sticky Notes, Slack, Special requirements, Surveys, Sponsors, Sightseeing, Software Carpentry

#### Skill-up



#### Sticky Notes

We love sticky notes! No Carpentries workshop is possible without the sticky notes. See [Greg's collection of tips and techniques for teaching with sticky notes](https://github.com/gvwilson/sticky-note-teaching) to learn the various reasons it makes learning and teaching easier. Therefore, we will be using (even over-using!) these during the skill-up sessions, workshops and wherever possible.

#### Slack


#### Special requirements

We want to assist you in all possible ways to make your participation at CarpentryConnect enjoyable and stress-free. Please contact the organisers with any requests for special needs so that we can make arrangements before your arrival. Do not hesitate to contact the Welcome Team during the meeting for any help. (see *Arrival and Access, Childcare, Inclusion*)

#### Surveys


#### Sponsors



#### Sightseeing


#### Software Carpentry

The Software Carpentry Foundation and its sibling project, Data Carpentry, have merged to become The Carpentries. Since 1998, Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. Our volunteer instructors have run hundreds of events for more than 34,000 researchers since 2012. All of our lesson materials are freely reusable under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.

Like *Data Carpentry*, we will have a desk at the conference where you can learn more about this project.

### X: _X out inequality_


*We can't emphasize this enough!*

The globally diverse community of The Carpentries provides equal opportunities to everyone irrespective of their background (both technical and non-technical). We will maintain the same ethics at CarpentryCon and would request all our participants to familiarize themselves with our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

***Discrimination in any form, including behavior or remarks against any nationality, ethnicity, sexuality, religious and cultural belief, will not be tolerated!*** (also see *Allies, Code of Conduct, Diversity, Inclusion*)

### Y: You!

This event is for **you**. The success of this conference will be measured by what you gain at the conference and afterward in terms of skills, knowledge, and networking.

Be mindful that the organizers are also volunteers who are organizing this for the community by working beyond their work. Therefore, we invite you to step in if you see that something at the conference is not working and you have the idea and capacity to *fix* it for others.


**We are looking forward to welcoming you to CapentryConnect Johannesburg 2018!**
