                <td><a href="https://allegravia.github.io/website/about/">Dr. Allegra Via</a> is a physicist and scientific researcher at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Pathology (IBPM) of the National Research Council (CNR, Rome, IT). She is involved in the design, organisation and delivery of bioinformatics training courses, in Train the Trainer activities, and collaborate with other ELIXIR’s nodes on many training-related initiatives. She has a long track record of academic teaching (Macromolecular Structures, Python programming, Bioinformatics, Biochemistry, Protein interactions). Allegra's main research interests include protein structural bioinformatics, protein structure and function prediction and analysis, and protein interactions. She's also strongly interested in what researchers have discovered about how people learn and how best to teach them, and how research findings in the science of learning (educational psychology) can be translated into common teaching practice. Allegra is a member of the Global Organisation of Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training (GOBLET) and a Software/Data Carpentry Instructor and Instructor trainer.</td>

Her research interest is in predicting the genetic risk of brain diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and glioblastoma brain tumour. To achieve this, she develops data analysis pipelines, as well as model-based statistical approaches, that integrate genome-wide variation with several brain imaging features and investigate their relationships. She writes her codes in R, python, shell scripting and uses various open source bioinformatics tools. Samar is enthusiastic about teaching researchers the basics of statistics and programming skills. She joined the Carpentries team and became an instructor in 2017, and since then, she got involved in teaching and organising several Carpentries workshops, including the first Software Carpentry workshop in Sudan. </td>

Her current research at Pharmacen entails kinetic analyses of extemporaneously compounded medicines. She obtained her B.Sc. degree in Biochemistry and Microbiology, followed by an M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences (Molecular Biology) at the NWU. During her studies, she didn't receive any formal training in computational skills and had to seek help to analyze Next-Generation Sequencing data. She was advised to attend a Software Carpentry workshop in November 2015, which piqued her interest in data analyses. In 2016, she certified as a Carpentry instructor and organized and taught at a Genomics Data Carpentry workshop soon thereafter. Since then, she has taught at several Data Carpentry workshops, as well as 3 one-day R workshops. Additionally, she has lead several study group sessions to up-skill and support her colleagues. During these informal meetings they worked through Data Carpentry lessons on command-line, cloud computing and R to provide an environment for post-workshop learning and support. In 2017, she was invited to be a tutor at the CODATA-RDA Summer School, Trieste, Italy, where they teach foundational skills to researchers across various domains. She is part of the CODATA-RDA Task Force and recently also acted as one of the mentors for The Carpentries. She mostly uses cloud computing and R for data analyses, and is very passionate about teaching these tools to others. </td>

Although I never though of myself as a teacher, I have found myself enjoying teaching in the various Carpentries, and what began as a means to close the gap between what researchers need and what the support IT brings to the table, has grown into a full-on passion to teach people, to better equip those who do not even know yet of what is available to them as streamlined methods and tools. In 2018 I was fortunate enough to be part of the world-first Carpentry Con in Dublin and have since taught in a few carpentries, as well as assisting where I can. Ironically the tools we teach researchers are so applicable to situations outside of research that I was able to adapt it to my current working environment and a lot of people, even outside of my professional circle, was able to adapt these tools similarly. I am thrilled and honored to be part of the Carpentries family!</td>
