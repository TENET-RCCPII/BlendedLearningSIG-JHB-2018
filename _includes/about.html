                                        <p class="text-muted">Over the past few years most universities in SA have established or participated in various forums to discuss and develop institutional eLearning offerings, approaches, strategies, and policies. These discussions and developments often take place inside the IT departments, the Centres for Teaching and Learning or within Faculties. Through conversations within ASAUDIT, IT directors and practitioners recognised the need to find a platform where discussions can span institutions, as well as academic departments, teaching and learning centres, and the IT support divisions to optimise skill sharing and reduce duplication of efforts.

The ASAUDIT Blended Learning SIG was established in 2017 and two in-person meetings were held since then. The first meeting took place at Stellenbosch University in November 2017 and the second at Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth on 18 June 2018.

                                        <p class="text-muted">To establish a sustainable community of practice around blended learning and e-learning across South African universities, practitioners and technology providers have to find ways to communicate regularly about requirements, challenges, technologies, opportunities, and solutions. The ASAUDIT Blended Learning SIG have already provided opportunities for two in-person meetings. These meetings were well-represented by institutions across the country. The third meeting taking place in November in Johannesburg, will provide opportunities for new members to join the existing community and to expand the conversation. It will also give the community an opportunity to re-visit some of the conversations from previous meetings to decide what actions can be taken to further ideas presented previously.
